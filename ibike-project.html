            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                As a part of my project at the Industry Experience unit at Monash University, my team and I were committed to addressing the vital issue of cyclist safety in Melbourne. From week 3 to week 12, we meticulously crafted the iBike Ride App, a pivotal tool designed in iterative phases every three weeks. Our focused efforts were aimed at reducing cycling accidents, thereby nurturing a more sustainable and secure environment for the cycling community in the city.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                In Melbourne, the safety of cyclists is a growing concern, especially given 55 cyclist deaths on Victorian roads over the last five years. The main issues contributing to this problem are shared roads with trucks and a lack of dedicated bike lanes. As the city grows and aims for a greener lifestyle, the need to address cyclist safety has become urgent. Melbourne's goal is to cut cycling accidents by 80% by 2030, setting a challenging yet necessary target. 
                How might we develop simple and effective ways to make daily commuting safer for Melbourne's cyclists, while also improving the overall cycling environment in the city?.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The iBike Ride App project was an endeavor that showcased the power of user-centered design in promoting safety and well-being within the cycling community of Melbourne. As part of a dedicated team of three, we engaged in a comprehensive design and development process, employing various user research methodologies such as interviews, surveys, and usability testing over a 9-week period. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My contributions as a Business Analyst and UI/UX Designer were pivotal in shaping the app's direction. Through the creation of wireframes and prototypes, I was able to translate user needs into tangible design solutions that were iteratively refined using Figma. The culmination of this effort was a design system that not only resonated with our users but also significantly improved the user experience of the iBike platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final project on expo recieved positive feedback from users, highlighting the effectiveness of the solutions provided. This project, as part of the Industry Experience unit at Monash University, was not just an academic exercise but a real-world application of skill and innovation that contributed to the greater good of Melbourne's cycling community.
