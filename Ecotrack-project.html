        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As part of Industry experience unit at Monash University, our team was given the profound task of addressing Victorians' high carbon emissions through energy consumption. Our objective was to design an app that would educate and encourage sustainable energy usage to align with Australia's renewable energy goals for 2030.</p>

        <!-- Problem Statement Section -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The 2005 report by EPA Victoria revealed a crucial gap in the understanding of carbon emissions among Australians. Our project aimed to design a system that would motivate Victorians to make informed and sustainable energy choices, ultimately reducing their carbon footprint.</p>

            <h2>My Role: Business Analyst & UI/UX Designer </h2>
            <p>In this project, I took on the role of a Business Analyst. My significant contribution was in the design process, where I created a high-fidelity Figma prototype that provided a comprehensive visualization of the app's user experience, focusing on the crucial features required to drive change in energy consumption behavior.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Epic and Features</h2>
            <p>The design revolved around a central epic: to equip parents with the knowledge of their carbon footprint, thus enabling them to foster a greener environment and reduce living costs. This translated into two main features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feature 1: Carbon Footprint Calculator</strong> - This feature allows users to input various household activities to understand and manage their emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature 2: Neighbourhood Comparison Tool</strong> - With this, users can compare their carbon output with their neighbors, encouraging community-wide sustainable practices.</li>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>User Journey Mapping</h2>
            
                <p>The user journey for the EcoTrack app is a thoughtful expedition from awareness to action. It's designed to guide parents in understanding and reducing their household's carbon emissions. Here's how we've charted the course:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stage 1: Awareness and Onboarding</strong> - The journey begins with the user recognizing the need to reduce their carbon footprint. Initial app interactions are designed to be intuitive, laying the groundwork for a seamless experience.
                    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stage 2: Engagement with CO2 Calculator</strong> - Users engage with the CO2 Calculator to enter data and get real-time emissions feedback. This stage is crucial for users to understand the impact of their daily activities.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stage 3: Comparison and Community</strong> - The app allows users to select their suburb and compare emissions with their community, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and collective action towards a greener future.
                       
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stage 4: Action and Reflection</strong> - Armed with insights, users are nudged to implement energy-saving measures. The journey culminates with reflection on the positive changes made, both financially and environmentally.
                        
                    </li>
